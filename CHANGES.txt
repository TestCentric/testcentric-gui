TestCentric Runner for NUnit 1.0.0-Alpha1 - August 3, 2018

General

This is the initial alpha release of the TestCentric Runner for NUnit. It is not yet recommended
for use in production work.

Features

This GUI runner resembles the NUnit V2 GUI, but since it runs NUnit 3 tests the internal implementation
is entirely new. In addition, features not available or not easily supported in NUnit 3 have been
removed. Some key differences from the V2 GUI are...

 * The GUI itself targets .NET 4.5, rather than 2.0.
 * We use chocolatey as the primary distribution method for the GUI. This makes extensions that are
 also installed through chocolatey available when running under the GUI. A zip file is also provided.
 * Displaying tests as a flat list of fixtures is not supported.
 * Merging tests in the same namespace across assemblies is not supported.
 * The GUI no longer understands the layout of NUnit project files, which is taken care of by the 
 NUnit test engine. Consequently, menu items relating to creating, editiong and saving such files 
 are no longer present.
 * The ability to open project files, including NUnit and VS projects, is dependent on the presence
 of the approprate engine extensions, which are not bundled with the GUI.
