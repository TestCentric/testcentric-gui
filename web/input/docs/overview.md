# About TestCentric Runner

NUnit V2 came with both a console runner and a GUI. Beginning with NUnit 3, no GUI runner was provided.
The TestCentric GUI aims to fill that need. The version 1 series is similar in appearance of the NUnit
V2 GUI, but has internal modifications to allow it to run NUnit 3 tests. Using a standard NUnit extension,
it is also able to run tests written for the NUnit V2 framework. Future releases will eventually support
other frameworks.

# Versioning

The TestCentric GUI uses semantic versioning, with specific exceptions and clarification
regarding what is considered a breaking change. See the VERSIONING.md file in the root of the
distribution for more information. The current version is 1.5.0.

# License

The GUI is Open Source software, released under the MIT / X11 license. See LICENSE.txt in the root of the distribution or view it [here](/testcentric-gui/docs/license.html).

The software bundles a modified copy of the NUnit test engine, which is also licensed under the
MIT / X11 license. In addition, the first version of the GUI is based in part on the NUnit 2.x
GUI runner, released under the NUnit license. See NOTICES.txt in the root of the distribution
for more information.
